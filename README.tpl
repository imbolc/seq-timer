## Contributing

We appreciate all kinds of contributions, thank you!

### Note on README

The `README.md` file isn't meant to be changed directly. It instead generated from the crate's docs
by the [cargo-readme] command:

* Install the command if you don't have it: `cargo install cargo-readme`
* Change the crate-level docs in `src/lib.rs`, or wrapping text in `README.tpl`
* Apply the changes: `cargo readme > README.md`

If you have [rusty-hook] installed the changes will apply automatically on commit.
